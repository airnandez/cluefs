# `cluefs` â€” ToDo

This is the list of items we would like to implement, in no particular order:

* Create a `cluefs` package which could be embedded in other applications
* Develop a proper set of automated tests
* Add support for lock-related operations (see `fcntl(3)`)
* Finish documentation of the few event formats still remaining
* ~~Provide downloadable executables for each one of the supported platforms for making it easy to install the utility by non developers~~
